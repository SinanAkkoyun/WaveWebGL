# WaveWebGL

I quickly wrote this repo to explain light wave interferences, reflection and refraction to a uni friend of mine based on simple wave principles.

# Short explanation:

When casting a beam of coherent (laser) light, one can think of the linear wavefront as a superposition of infinitesimal radial waves, all with the same phase (meaning synchronized in time).
Now, when the beam hits a reflective surface, the left corner of the wavefront hits first, the right corner hits the surface at last. The newly reflected "radial" elementary waves (Huygen) hitting the surface first have a different phase than the waves that hit the surface later, therefore an reflected beam occurs with the angle of incidence.


This was my first shader and WebGL project
